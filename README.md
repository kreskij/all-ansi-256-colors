# All Ansi 256 Colors

I created this resource to help visualize the color options available for 256 color terminal emulators. The included ```all-ansi-colors-pretty.html``` file offers a simple and quick way of scrolling through all possible foreground/background color combinations.

The included shell script was used to generate the combinations. The output of the script is rather large, it will print 256*256=65536 strings, each being escaped to show a different foreground/background color combination.


I converted the output to an HTML file for easy browsing using the following command (requires ansi2html):

```bash all-ansi-256-colors.sh | ansi2html > all-ansi-256-colors.html```
    
A pre-generated HTML file is included in the repository ```all-ansi-256-colors.html```. The "pretty" version, ```all-ansi-256-colors-pretty.html``` includes buttons that you can click to toggle bold, italics, and underlines of the text since most terminal emulators support those styles.
